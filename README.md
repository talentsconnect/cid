[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michipili/cid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michipili/cid?branch=master)

## Setup guide

## Administrative operations

### Example configuration directory

The SSH configuration is just a regular SSH configuration file which
is made available to the cid user, which allows it to access remote
directories.

The GPG key is added to the keyring of the cid user and can be used to
sign software.

~~~ console
% find ./local -type f
./local/gpg/01234567
./local/cid.conf
./local/ssh/config
./local/ssh/id_rsa_github
~~~

The `cid.conf` enumerates the trac environments to configure.  Each
environment configured has the form

~~~ conf
[local]
location = /trac/local
admin = alice
~~~

where location stands for the location served by the Apache server.
