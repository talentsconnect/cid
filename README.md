# El Cid, Count of Bivar and Prince of Continuous Integration and Deployment Systems

The **El Cid** project aims at providing a continuous integration and
deployment system that is easy to deploy locally as well as in the
cloud.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michipili/cid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michipili/cid?branch=master)

## Setup guide

## Build docker images

~~~ console
% ./tool/docker_build linux admin gitserver jenkins postgresql reverseproxy trac
~~~

## Administrative operations

### Example configuration directory

Here is a listing for a configuration directory to use:

~~~ console
% find ./local -type f
./local/gpg/01234567
./local/cid.conf
./local/ssh/config
./local/ssh/id_rsa_github
./local/Dockerfile
~~~

The `cid.conf` enumerates the trac environments to configure.  Each
environment configured has the form

~~~ conf
[local]
location = /trac/local
admin = alice
~~~

where location stands for the location served by the Apache
server. All other parts are optional.

The SSH configuration is just a regular SSH configuration file which
is made available to the cid user, which allows it to access remote
directories.

The GPG key is added to the keyring of the cid user and can be used to
sign software.

The Dockerfile describe a custom Jenkins installation, with
dependencies tailored to the project.  It can start from `cid/jenkins`.
